work log, volcano port to windows
12/6	* fixed non-textured ground drawing.  the 4th parameter in glDrawElements() was not an offset, but a data pointer 
	* added include dirs for glad & glfw to release build configuration
	* when running from command line, need these files in the same dir as exe:
		volcano_ground.png, particle.vp, particle.fp, texmesh.vp, texmesh.fp 

12/5    * fixed corrupt heap, random exceptions thrown during runtime: (in link shaders, read shader source, etc.) exceptions change when stepping thru code. need resizing arrays to not call resize(), that is make sure the reserved storage is less than the number of items added.  possibly do a through unit test on resizing array. added glfw error callback

12/4	* texture loading works with lodepng software

11/21   * got textures working on generated checkerboard

11/20 	* added wireframe for volcano

11/16	* sick day, slept in to 2:30 with headache
	* fixed clipped particles not drawing at emitter location
		glDrawElements() did not have correct # of elements passed.  also fixes to parameters sent to buffer draw calls.  clean up vbo memory layout

11/15	* debugging clipped particles bug

11/14	* debugging clipped particles bug

11/13

11/8/2017
	* got particles as points drawing (i think)
	* fixed problem with resizing array not using N member
